# SpringthunderDZ
Do you want to fire spring thunder shell out of your dart zone blasters? While still having a scar(pcar)? Here you go!

Print all the parts,
Glue the hinge to the underside of both of the shellblock and the scar part.
Use a ruberband to hold the parts together so that it stays closed.

IMPORTANT,
sand the long part you will stick in your DZ blaster carefully otherwise it might be stuck! (this is because i have noticed a diffence in the DZ barrel points)
Sand the part where the back end of the shell would fit in to it might not be perfect.

Last of these shells are made by gdop26 and i don't own any of the files for the shells. The idea for the shells and the shells themselves all belong to him and can be found on his website or the files can be found on his thingiverse and website.

I might update these scar part to also fit either 17/32 brass or other standard barrels.
